   Picasa was an image organizer and image viewer for organizing and editing digital photos, plus an integrated photo-sharing website, originally created by a company named Lifescape[3] (which at that time may have resided at Idealab) in 2002.[4] In July 2004, Google acquired Picasa from Lifescape and began offering it as freeware.[4] "Picasa" is a blend of the name of Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, the phrase mi casa (Spanish for "my house") and "pic" for pictures.[4][5]

Native applications for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Mac OS X (Intel only) were available from Google. For Linux, Google has bundled Wine with the Windows version to create an installation package rather than write a native Linux version, but this version is severely out of date[citation needed] (the latest Windows version, however, can be run with Wine; see the Linux section). There is also an iPhoto plugin or a standalone program for uploading photos available for Mac OS X 10.4 and later.

On February 12, 2016, Google announced it was discontinuing support for Picasa Desktop and Web Albums, effective March 15, 2016, and focusing on the cloud-based Google Photos as its successor.[6] Picasa Web Albums, a companion service will be closed on May 1, 2016. The announcement triggered backlash from users on Google's Picasa web forums[7] and calls for the product to be Open Sourced, or sold to keep it in the marketplace,.[8].</p>
